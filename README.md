# Abstract

Food culture plays an important role in
Chinese culture. However Chinese dishes
is usually cooked with much oil and stir-fried, which leads to harsh working
conditions for cooks and waiters in the
kitchen. Chinese kitchens, especially
those in the restaurant, often have
problems as high temperatures, high
humidity, high smoke concentrations and
the risk of fire in some situation.

Our project is a kitchen comfort monitoring system based on machine learning intelligent classification controlled by Raspberry Pi and cloud computer. We hope to improve the situation and solve these problems with our kitchen comfort monitoring system. It has three main functions:
1. Real - time monitoring:
monitor environment around from sensors
2. Intelligetn classification:
invoke machine learning model to classify the state of environment
3. Automatic Control:
automatically control the actuator by judging the state
